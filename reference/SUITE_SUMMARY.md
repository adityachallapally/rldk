## **🐛 Intentional Bugs for RLDK to Catch**

### **Summarization Helpfulness Task**
1. **KL divergence spike at step 47** (learning rate too high)
2. **Non-deterministic training** (missing seed in data loader)
3. **Reward saturation** (aggressive scaling causes signal loss)

### **Refusal Safety Task**
1. **Data leakage** (validation examples in training)
2. **Safety degradation** (performance drops after step 150)
3. **Shortcut learning** (model refuses everything)

### **Code Fix Prompts Task**
1. **Memory leak** (GPU memory grows unbounded)
2. **Poor calibration** (reward model overconfident)
3. **Gradient explosion** (training becomes unstable)

rldk_monitor = TrainingMonitor(
    trainer=trainer,
    metrics=["reward", "kl_divergence", "policy_loss"],
    output_dir="trl_analysis"
