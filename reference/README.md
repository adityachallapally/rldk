## **Success Stories**

> "RLDK caught a KL divergence spike in 5 minutes that would have taken me hours to debug manually. The drift card showed exactly where the problem started and suggested the right fix." - ML Researcher

> "The determinism harness found that our data augmentation was non-deterministic. RLDK not only caught it but gave us the exact fix we needed." - RL Engineer

> "We use RLDK in our CI/CD pipeline now. It catches regressions before they hit production and gives us confidence in our training runs." - ML Platform Team
