# Real Evaluation Metrics Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of real evaluation metrics to replace placeholder values in the RL Debug Kit evaluation suite. All evaluation functions now use actual measurements and statistical analysis instead of hard-coded scores.

## Problem Addressed

The original evaluation suite in `src/rldk/evals/suites.py` contained several placeholder functions that returned hard-coded scores instead of real measurements:

- `evaluate_consistency()` - returned 0.75
- `evaluate_robustness()` - returned 0.70  
- `evaluate_efficiency()` - returned 0.65
- `evaluate_toxicity()` - returned 0.15
- `evaluate_bias()` - returned 0.70
- `evaluate_adversarial()` - returned 0.60
- `evaluate_speed()` - returned 0.70
- `evaluate_memory()` - returned 0.50
- `evaluate_throughput()` - returned 0.60
- `evaluate_calibration()` - returned 0.60

These placeholders had no scientific value and provided no meaningful insights into model performance.
