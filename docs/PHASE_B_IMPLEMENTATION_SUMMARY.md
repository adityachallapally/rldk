### 3. CLI Commands ✅

**File**: `src/rldk/cli.py` (updated)

New card generation commands:
```bash
# Determinism card
rldk card determinism runA

# Drift card (comparing two runs)
rldk card drift runA runB

# Reward card
rldk card reward runA
```

### 4. Documentation ✅

**File**: `docs/card_field_reference.md`

- **Comprehensive field reference** for all card types
- **Interpretation guidelines** for each field
- **CLI usage examples**
- **Schema validation information**
- **Best practices and troubleshooting**

## Technical Implementation Details

### Event Schema Architecture

```python
@dataclass
class Event:
    step: int
    wall_time: float
    metrics: Dict[str, float]
    rng: Dict[str, Any]
    data_slice: Dict[str, Any]
    model_info: Dict[str, Any]
    notes: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
```

### Card Generation Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion**: Convert raw training data to normalized Events
2. **Analysis**: Perform domain-specific analysis (determinism, drift, reward health)
3. **Card Creation**: Generate structured card data with analysis results
4. **Output**: Save JSON cards and PNG visualizations to `runs/{run_id}/rldk_cards/`

### File Structure

```
runs/
└── {run_id}/
    └── rldk_cards/
        ├── determinism_card.json
        ├── determinism_card.png
        ├── drift_card.json
        ├── drift_card.png
        ├── reward_card.json
        └── reward_card.png
```

## Schema Validation

All cards are validated against JSON schemas defined in `src/rldk/io/schemas.py`:

- `DeterminismCardV2`: Determinism card schema
- `DriftCardV1`: Drift card schema
- `RewardCardV1`: Reward card schema

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite covering:
- ✅ Event schema functionality
- ✅ Card generation for all three types
- ✅ Schema validation
- ✅ Edge cases (empty events, single events)
