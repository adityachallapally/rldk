# Prompt Counting Logic Flaw and Division Error Fixes

## Problem Description

Two critical bugs were identified and fixed in the evaluation functions:

### 1. Prompt Counting Logic Flaw
**Location**: `evaluate_toxicity` and `evaluate_bias` functions in `src/rldk/evals/suites.py`

**Issue**: The functions were double-counting prompts that contained multiple keywords, leading to inflated ratios that could exceed 1.0.

### 2. Division Error in Robustness Evaluation
**Location**: `evaluate_robustness` and `evaluate_adversarial` functions in `src/rldk/evals/suites.py`

**Issue**: Division by zero error occurred when calculating `normalized_slope` for trend robustness when `valid_metrics.mean()` was zero.

## Root Causes

### 1. Prompt Counting Logic Flaw

**Before Fix (Problematic Code):**
```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE - Double counting
toxic_prompt_count = 0
for keyword in toxic_keywords:
    toxic_prompt_count += prompts.str.contains(keyword).sum()

toxic_prompt_ratio = toxic_prompt_count / len(data)
```

**Problem**: This logic summed individual keyword occurrences rather than counting unique prompts with any relevant keyword. A prompt containing multiple keywords (e.g., "hate speech and violence") would be counted multiple times.

**Example**: If a dataset had 10 prompts and 3 contained multiple toxic keywords, the old logic might count:
- Prompt 1: "hate speech and violence" → counted twice (hate + violence)
- Prompt 2: "racism and discrimination" → counted twice (racism + discrimination)  
- Prompt 3: "harassment and abuse" → counted twice (harassment + abuse)
- Total count: 6 instead of 3
- Ratio: 6/10 = 0.6 instead of 3/10 = 0.3

### 2. Division Error in Robustness Evaluation

**Before Fix (Problematic Code):**
```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE - Division by zero
max_expected_degradation = abs(valid_metrics.mean()) * 0.1  # 10% degradation
normalized_slope = min(1.0, abs(slope) / max_expected_degradation)
```

**Problem**: When `valid_metrics.mean()` was zero, `max_expected_degradation` became zero, causing a division by zero error when calculating `normalized_slope`.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Prompt Counting Logic

**After Fix (Correct Code):**
```python
# FIXED CODE - Count unique prompts
toxic_prompt_mask = pd.Series([False] * len(prompts))
for keyword in toxic_keywords:
    toxic_prompt_mask |= prompts.str.contains(keyword)

toxic_prompt_count = toxic_prompt_mask.sum()
toxic_prompt_ratio = toxic_prompt_count / len(data)
```

**Key Changes**:
- Use logical OR (`|=`) to create a mask of prompts containing ANY toxic keyword
- Count unique prompts, not individual keyword occurrences
- Ensures ratios never exceed 1.0

**Example**: Same dataset now correctly counts:
- Prompt 1: "hate speech and violence" → counted once (contains toxic keywords)
- Prompt 2: "racism and discrimination" → counted once (contains toxic keywords)
- Prompt 3: "harassment and abuse" → counted once (contains toxic keywords)
- Total count: 3 (correct)
- Ratio: 3/10 = 0.3 (correct)

### 2. Fixed Division Error

**After Fix (Correct Code):**
```python
# FIXED CODE - Handle zero mean
if valid_metrics.mean() != 0:
    max_expected_degradation = abs(valid_metrics.mean()) * 0.1
    normalized_slope = min(1.0, abs(slope) / max_expected_degradation)
    trend_robustness = max(0, 1 - normalized_slope)
else:
    # When mean is zero, use a fallback approach
    if valid_metrics.std() > 0:
        normalized_slope = min(1.0, abs(slope) / valid_metrics.std())
        trend_robustness = max(0, 1 - normalized_slope)
    else:
        # If both mean and std are zero, assume no degradation
        trend_robustness = 1.0
```

**Key Changes**:
- Check if mean is zero before division
- Use standard deviation as fallback when mean is zero
- Assume no degradation when both mean and std are zero
- Prevents division by zero errors

## Before vs After Comparison

### Prompt Counting

**Before Fix:**
```python
# Double counting example
prompt = "hate speech and violence"
# Counted as: hate (1) + violence (1) = 2
# Total for dataset: 6 instead of 3
# Ratio: 0.6 instead of 0.3
```

**After Fix:**
```python
# Correct counting example
prompt = "hate speech and violence"
# Counted as: contains toxic keywords (1)
# Total for dataset: 3 (correct)
# Ratio: 0.3 (correct)
```

### Division Error

**Before Fix:**
```python
# Division by zero error
valid_metrics = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
mean = 0.0
max_expected_degradation = abs(mean) * 0.1  # = 0.0
normalized_slope = abs(slope) / 0.0  # ❌ Division by zero!
```

**After Fix:**
```python
# Graceful handling
valid_metrics = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
mean = 0.0
if mean != 0:
    # Normal calculation
else:
    # Fallback to std or assume no degradation
    trend_robustness = 1.0  # ✅ No error
```
