## üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

### Fixed Issues
1. **Metrics Copy Bug (P0)**: Fixed crash in `ComprehensivePPOForensics.update()` when copying metrics with nested dataclasses. The `to_dict()` method flattened nested tracker metrics into keys that don't exist on `ComprehensivePPOMetrics`, causing `TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument`. **Fix**: Use `copy.deepcopy()` instead of unpacking flattened dictionary.

2. **Iterator Exhaustion Bug (P1)**: Fixed issue in `scan_ppo_events_comprehensive()` where the events iterator was exhausted by the original PPO scan before comprehensive analysis could run. **Fix**: Convert iterator to list first, then pass to both analyses.

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: The `to_dict()` method in nested dataclasses creates flattened keys like `kl_schedule_current_kl` that don't match the `ComprehensivePPOMetrics` field names
- **Solution**: Use `copy.deepcopy()` for proper dataclass copying without field name conflicts
- **Impact**: Both fixes ensure the comprehensive forensics system works reliably in production
