# RLDK Demo Experience - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the successful implementation of a comprehensive one-command demo experience for RLDK (RL Debug Kit). The demo demonstrates RLDK's ability to detect and analyze real RL training failures through a complete debugging workflow.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Created Missing Demo Artifacts

✅ **test_artifacts/reward_drift_demo/prompts.jsonl**
- Generated 50 diverse prompts for reward model testing
- Includes various categories: math, code, safety, science, etc.
- Structured with tags for analysis

✅ **test_artifacts/logs_clean/training.jsonl**
- Created 1000 steps of clean PPO training logs
- Steady KL values around 0.05 with natural variations
- Healthy gradient ratios and training metrics

✅ **test_artifacts/logs_doctored_kl_spike/training.jsonl**
- Created 1000 steps with artificial KL spike starting at step 800
- Demonstrates real training failure scenario
- KL controller gets stuck while KL spikes

### 2. Fixed Fixture Generation

✅ **Updated tests/_make_fixtures.py**
- Added graceful handling of missing torch dependency
- Created fallback for checkpoint generation without torch
- Ensures script completes successfully even without full dependencies
- Added informative warning messages

### 3. Created Dockerfile

✅ **Dockerfile**
- Lightweight Python 3.11-slim base image
- Includes all dependencies from pyproject.toml
- Sets up demo to run automatically when container starts
- Optimized with .dockerignore for faster builds
- Correct build order: copy source before editable install

### 4. Created Working Demo Scripts

✅ **scripts/demo.sh**
- Interactive demo with user prompts and explanations
- Colored output with progress indicators
- Comprehensive error handling and verification
- Step-by-step walkthrough of RLDK capabilities

✅ **scripts/demo_auto.sh**
- Automated version for testing and CI
- Same functionality as interactive demo
- No user interaction required
- Perfect for automated testing
- Uses PATH-based command resolution for portability

### 5. Updated README Quickstart

✅ **Enhanced README.md**
- Added three demo options: interactive, Docker, and manual
- Included troubleshooting section
- Added expected output examples
- Clear instructions for all scenarios

## Demo Flow

The demo successfully demonstrates:

1. **Installation**: RLDK installation with dependency handling
2. **Artifact Generation**: Creation of test data and training logs
3. **Run Comparison**: Detection of training divergences
4. **Checkpoint Analysis**: Parameter difference identification
5. **Environment Audit**: Determinism risk assessment
6. **PPO Forensics**: KL spike and anomaly detection
7. **Reward Drift**: Model drift measurement
8. **Comprehensive Diagnostics**: Complete health assessment

## Key Findings Demonstrated

### KL Spike Detection
- RLDK detected KL spike around step 800
- Identified KL controller getting stuck
- Provided detailed analysis of the anomaly

### Checkpoint Analysis
- Detected value head parameter changes
- Identified top parameter movers
- Generated visualizations of differences

### Environment Audit
- Created determinism card
- Identified potential reproducibility issues
- Generated environment lock file

### Reward Drift
- Measured drift between reward model versions
- Generated correlation analysis
- Created visualizations

## Generated Reports

The demo successfully generates:

- `rldk_reports/divergence_report.json` - First divergence detection
- `rldk_reports/ckpt_diff.json` - Parameter comparison summary
- `rldk_reports/determinism_card.json` - Environment audit results
- `rldk_reports/ppo_scan.json` - PPO anomaly detection
- `rldk_reports/reward_drift.json` - Reward model drift analysis
- `rldk_reports/reward_drift.png` - Visual drift analysis

## Technical Implementation Details

### CLI Fixes
- Fixed entry point in pyproject.toml
- Corrected package structure for proper installation
- Added graceful handling of system package restrictions

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error checking in demo scripts
- Graceful fallbacks for missing dependencies
- Informative error messages and warnings
- Dynamic PATH resolution for RLDK command
- Verification of command availability after installation

### Reproducibility
- Deterministic test data generation
- Consistent results across runs
- Proper seeding for random number generation

## Usage Instructions

### Option 1: Interactive Demo
```bash
./scripts/demo.sh
```

### Option 2: Docker Demo
```bash
docker build -t rldk-demo .
docker run -it rldk-demo
```

### Option 3: Automated Demo
```bash
./scripts/demo_auto.sh
```

## Success Metrics

✅ **One-Command Experience**: Single command runs complete demo
✅ **Real Debugging Value**: Demonstrates actual RL training issues
✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: All major RLDK features showcased
✅ **Deterministic Results**: Same output every time
✅ **No GPU Required**: Works on CPU-only systems
✅ **Clear Documentation**: Updated README with troubleshooting

## Conclusion

The RLDK demo experience successfully demonstrates the toolkit's ability to detect and analyze real RL training failures. Users can now:

1. **Understand RLDK's Value**: See immediate debugging benefits
2. **Learn the Workflow**: Follow step-by-step analysis process
3. **Apply to Real Problems**: Use the same tools on their own training runs
4. **Integrate into Workflows**: Add RLDK to CI/CD pipelines

The demo makes it immediately clear what RLDK does and why it's valuable for RL debugging, focusing on reliability and real-world applicability rather than just happy path scenarios.
