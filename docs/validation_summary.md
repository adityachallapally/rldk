#### Reward Drift Results
- **Pearson correlation**: 0.0823 (low correlation indicating drift)
- **Sign flip rate**: 0.6250 (high sign flip rate indicating drift)
- **Spearman correlation**: -0.1190

#### Determinism Card

- **Environment flags detected**: âœ… TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM captured
- **Nondeterminism hints**: 4 (as expected)

### Validation Tasks Completed

#### âœ… 1. Setup, clone, install
- Python 3.13.3 environment created
- Virtual environment activated
- Package installed with dev dependencies: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`

#### âœ… 2. Generate offline fixtures
- All required paths exist and are non-empty:
  - `test_artifacts/logs_clean/`
  - `test_artifacts/logs_doctored_kl_spike/`
  - `test_artifacts/ckpt_identical/`
  - `test_artifacts/ckpt_value_head_edit/`
  - `test_artifacts/reward_drift_demo/`

#### âœ… 3. CLI smoke and report generation
All CLI commands executed successfully with exit code 0:
- `rldk env-audit test_artifacts/logs_clean`
- `rldk forensics log-scan test_artifacts/logs_doctored_kl_spike`
- `rldk diff-ckpt test_artifacts/ckpt_identical/a.pt test_artifacts/ckpt_identical/b.pt`
- `rldk diff-ckpt test_artifacts/ckpt_value_head_edit/a.pt test_artifacts/ckpt_value_head_edit/b.pt`
- `rldk reward-drift test_artifacts/reward_drift_demo/rmA test_artifacts/reward_drift_demo/rmB --prompts test_artifacts/reward_drift_demo/prompts.jsonl`
- `rldk compare-runs test_artifacts/logs_clean test_artifacts/logs_doctored_kl_spike`
- `rldk forensics doctor test_artifacts/logs_doctored_kl_spike`

#### âœ… 4. Required files generated
All required files exist and are non-empty:
- `rldk_reports/determinism_card.json`
- `rldk_reports/ppo_scan.json`
- `rldk_reports/ckpt_diff.json`
- `rldk_reports/reward_drift.json`
- `rldk_reports/reward_drift.png` (63KB)

#### âœ… 5. Content assertions on JSON reports
All JSON content assertions passed:
- Determinism card contains expected flags and structure
- PPO scan contains controller rules for doctored logs
- Checkpoint diff shows expected cosine similarities
- Reward drift contains all required metrics with expected values

#### âœ… 6. Determinism across repeated runs
- Two identical runs of `rldk forensics log-scan` produced identical results
- KL median and grad ratio median values match within tolerance
- Repeatability test passed

#### âœ… 7. Negative path validation
- Clean logs show only advantage_reward_hacking (no spike/controller rules)
- Expected anomaly detection behavior confirmed

#### âœ… 8. Tiny model load with real tensors
- Successfully created and compared tiny PyTorch models
- Detected significant differences (avg_cosine: -0.5214)
- Top movers analysis working correctly

#### âœ… 9. Packaging sanity
- Wheel builds successfully: `python -m build`
- Wheel installs in clean environment
- CLI commands work after wheel installation
- Module imports work correctly

#### âœ… 10. Optional environment audit toggle
- Environment variable `TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=true` detected
- Determinism card captures environment flags correctly

### Issues Found and Fixed

#### ðŸ”§ Import Issues Fixed
- **Problem**: Missing exports in `src/rldk/replay/__init__.py`
- **Solution**: Added proper exports for `ReplayReport`, `_compare_metrics`, `_prepare_replay_command`
- **Problem**: Relative imports failing in `src/rldk/replay/replay.py`
- **Solution**: Changed relative imports to absolute imports

#### ðŸ”§ Build Issues Fixed
- **Problem**: Virtual environment directory causing build failures
- **Solution**: Cleaned up temporary directories before building

### Package Status: READY FOR PRODUCTION âœ…

The RLDK package is now fully functional and ready for seamless installation and use. All core functionality works correctly:

- âœ… CLI commands execute successfully
- âœ… Reports are generated with correct content
- âœ… Models load and process correctly
- âœ… Deterministic behavior across runs
- âœ… Proper anomaly detection
- âœ… Wheel packaging works
- âœ… Environment detection works

### Installation Instructions

The package can now be installed seamlessly with:

```bash
# For development
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# For production
pip install rldk

# Or from wheel
pip install dist/*.whl
```

All CLI commands will work immediately after installation without any additional setup required.
