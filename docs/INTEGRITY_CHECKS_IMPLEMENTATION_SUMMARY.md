# Evaluation Integrity Checks Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of evaluation integrity checks for RL Debug Kit, which detect prompt contamination and answer leakage in evaluation data.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Integrity Module (`src/rldk/evals/integrity.py`)

**Note**: The temporal ordering violation detection was fixed to correctly compare timestamp values instead of relying on pandas index alignment, which was causing false negatives.

Created a comprehensive integrity checking module with four main evaluation functions:

#### `evaluate_prompt_contamination()`
- **Purpose**: Detects prompt contamination and bias
- **Checks**:
  - Duplicate prompts (potential contamination)
  - Prompt length anomalies (very short/long prompts)
  - Test-like patterns (e.g., "Answer the following question")
  - Metadata leakage (epoch, step, batch_idx values in prompts)
- **Score**: Higher score = less contamination

#### `evaluate_answer_leakage()`
- **Purpose**: Detects answer/solution leakage in prompts
- **Checks**:
  - Direct answer leakage (answer appears in prompt)
  - Partial answer leakage (key parts of answer in prompt)
  - Numerical answer leakage (numbers from answer in prompt)
  - Semantic similarity between prompts and responses
- **Score**: Higher score = less leakage

#### `evaluate_data_split_integrity()`
- **Purpose**: Detects contamination between data splits
- **Checks**:
  - Proper split distribution (balanced splits)
  - Duplicate content across splits
  - Temporal violations (if timestamps available) - **Fixed**: Now correctly detects out-of-order timestamps
- **Score**: Higher score = better integrity

#### `evaluate_evaluation_robustness()`
- **Purpose**: Checks evaluation reliability
- **Checks**:
  - Sample size adequacy
  - High variance in key metrics
  - Systematic biases (correlation with metadata)
  - Outliers that might skew results
- **Score**: Higher score = more robust

### 2. Integration with Evaluation Framework

#### Updated Evaluation Suites (`src/rldk/evals/suites.py`)
- **Quick Suite**: Added `prompt_contamination` and `answer_leakage` checks
- **Comprehensive Suite**: Added all four integrity checks
- **New Integrity Suite**: Dedicated suite focused on integrity checks
- **Updated baseline scores**: Set appropriate baseline scores for integrity metrics

#### Suite Configuration
```python
INTEGRITY_SUITE = {
    "name": "integrity",
    "description": "Integrity-focused evaluation suite for detecting contamination and leakage",
    "default_sample_size": 150,
    "estimated_runtime": "8-15 minutes",
    "evaluations": {
        "prompt_contamination": evaluate_prompt_contamination,
        "answer_leakage": evaluate_answer_leakage,
        "data_split_integrity": evaluate_data_split_integrity,
        "evaluation_robustness": evaluate_evaluation_robustness,
        "kl_divergence": evaluate_kl_divergence,
    },
    "baseline_scores": {
        "prompt_contamination": 0.8,  # Higher is better (less contamination)
        "answer_leakage": 0.8,  # Higher is better (less leakage)
        "data_split_integrity": 0.9,  # Higher is better (better integrity)
        "evaluation_robustness": 0.8,  # Higher is better (more robust)
        "kl_divergence": 0.8,  # Higher is better (lower KL divergence)
    },
}
```

### 3. Comprehensive Testing (`tests/test_integrity_checks.py`)

Created extensive test suite covering:
- **Basic functionality tests**: Verify all integrity checks work correctly
- **Detection tests**: Test specific detection scenarios (duplicates, leakage, etc.)
- **Edge case tests**: Handle missing data, small samples, etc.
- **Integration tests**: Verify integration with evaluation framework
- **Baseline score tests**: Ensure appropriate baseline scores

### 4. Documentation

#### User Guide (`EVALUATION_INTEGRITY_GUIDE.md`)
Comprehensive documentation including:
- **Quick start guide**: How to run integrity checks
- **Detailed explanations**: What each check does and how to interpret scores
- **Configuration options**: How to customize thresholds
- **Best practices**: When and how to use integrity checks
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and debugging tips
- **Performance considerations**: Runtime and memory usage

## Bug Fixes

### 1. Temporal Ordering Violation Detection Fix

**Issue**: The original implementation had a critical bug where temporal ordering violations were never detected due to incorrect pandas Series comparison.

**Problem**: The code was comparing `sorted_times == split_data[time_col]` where `sorted_times` was the result of `sort_values()`. Since `sort_values()` preserves the original indices, this comparison was always `True` because it was comparing sorted values with themselves at the same positions.

**Solution**: Changed the comparison to use `np.array_equal(original_times.values, sorted_times.values)` to compare the actual timestamp values instead of relying on index alignment.

**Before (buggy)**:
```python
sorted_times = split_data[time_col].sort_values()
if not (sorted_times == split_data[time_col]).all():  # Always False
    violations += 1
```

**After (fixed)**:
```python
original_times = split_data[time_col].values
sorted_times = split_data[time_col].sort_values().values
if not np.array_equal(original_times, sorted_times):  # Correctly detects violations
    violations += 1
```

## Key Features

### 1. Configurable Thresholds
All integrity checks use configurable thresholds that can be customized:
```python
# Example thresholds
CONTAMINATION_THRESHOLDS = {
    "duplicate_ratio": 0.1,      # >10% duplicates
    "test_pattern_ratio": 0.3,    # >30% test patterns
    "metadata_leakage_ratio": 0.05,  # >5% metadata leakage
}
```

### 2. Robust Detection Algorithms
- **Pattern matching**: Regex-based detection of test patterns
- **Statistical analysis**: Correlation analysis for systematic biases
- **Semantic similarity**: TF-IDF-based similarity detection
- **Outlier detection**: IQR-based outlier identification

### 3. Graceful Degradation
- **Missing data handling**: Returns neutral scores when data unavailable
- **Small sample handling**: Adjusts thresholds for small datasets
- **Error handling**: Continues evaluation even if individual checks fail

### 4. Performance Optimized
- **Efficient algorithms**: Fast detection without sacrificing accuracy
- **Sampling support**: Can sample large datasets for faster evaluation
- **Memory efficient**: Minimal memory footprint for large datasets

## Usage Examples

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Run dedicated integrity suite
rldk eval --suite integrity --data your_data.csv

# Run as part of quick evaluation
rldk eval --suite quick --data your_data.csv

# Run as part of comprehensive evaluation
rldk eval --suite comprehensive --data your_data.csv
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from rldk.evals.runner import run
from rldk.evals.integrity import evaluate_prompt_contamination

# Run full evaluation with integrity checks
result = run(data, suite="integrity", seed=42)

# Run specific integrity check
contamination_result = evaluate_prompt_contamination(data, seed=42)
print(f"Contamination score: {contamination_result['score']}")
```

## Test Results
