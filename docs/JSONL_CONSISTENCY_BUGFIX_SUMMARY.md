# JSONL Consistency Validation Bug Fix

## Bug Description

The `validate_jsonl_consistency` function was sorting the steps and times lists before checking for sequential steps and monotonic time. This meant the checks were performed on reordered data, not the original file sequence, which could lead to incorrect validation results and misleading line numbers in error reports.

### Affected File
- `src/rldk/io/validator.py` - `validate_jsonl_consistency` function

## Root Cause

The function was incorrectly sorting the data before validation:

```python
# BUGGY CODE
# Check sequential steps
if check_sequential_steps and steps:
    steps.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # ❌ SORTING BEFORE VALIDATION
    for i, (line_num, step) in enumerate(steps):
        if i > 0 and step <= steps[i-1][1]:
            issues.append(f"Line {line_num}: Non-sequential step {step} (previous: {steps[i-1][1]})")

# Check monotonic time
if check_monotonic_time and times:
    times.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # ❌ SORTING BEFORE VALIDATION
    for i, (line_num, time_val) in enumerate(times):
        if i > 0 and time_val < times[i-1][1]:
            issues.append(f"Line {line_num}: Non-monotonic time {time_val} (previous: {times[i-1][1]})")
```

This approach was fundamentally flawed because:
1. **Consistency validation should check the original file order**
2. **Sorting hides real data integrity issues**
3. **Line numbers become meaningless after sorting**

## Fix Implementation

**Removed the sorting and validated data in file order:**

```python
# FIXED CODE
# Check sequential steps (in file order)
if check_sequential_steps and steps:
    for i, (line_num, step) in enumerate(steps):
        if i > 0 and step <= steps[i-1][1]:
            issues.append(f"Line {line_num}: Non-sequential step {step} (previous: {steps[i-1][1]})")

# Check monotonic time (in file order)
if check_monotonic_time and times:
    for i, (line_num, time_val) in enumerate(times):
        if i > 0 and time_val < times[i-1][1]:
            issues.append(f"Line {line_num}: Non-monotonic time {time_val} (previous: {times[i-1][1]})")
```

## Impact

### Before Fix (Buggy Behavior)
- **Hidden Issues**: Real data integrity problems were masked by sorting
- **Misleading Results**: Files with serious issues could pass validation
- **Inaccurate Line Numbers**: Error reports pointed to wrong lines
- **False Confidence**: Users thought their data was consistent when it wasn't

### After Fix (Correct Behavior)
- **Accurate Detection**: Real issues are properly identified
- **Correct Line Numbers**: Error reports point to actual problem lines
- **True Validation**: Files are validated against their actual sequence
- **Reliable Results**: Users can trust the validation results

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Non-sequential Steps
**File Content:**
```jsonl
{"step": 1, "wall_time": 100.0}
{"step": 3, "wall_time": 101.0}  # Missing step 2
{"step": 2, "wall_time": 102.0}  # Step 2 comes after step 3
{"step": 4, "wall_time": 103.0}
```

**Before Fix (Buggy):**
- Steps sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4] → Would pass validation!
- Real issue hidden

**After Fix (Correct):**
- Detects: "Line 3: Non-sequential step 2 (previous: 3)"
- Correctly identifies the problem

### Scenario 2: Non-monotonic Time
**File Content:**
```jsonl
{"step": 1, "wall_time": 100.0}
{"step": 2, "wall_time": 99.0}   # Time goes backwards
{"step": 3, "wall_time": 101.0}  # Time goes forward again
{"step": 4, "wall_time": 102.0}
```

**Before Fix (Buggy):**
- Times sorted: [99.0, 100.0, 101.0, 102.0] → Would pass validation!
- Real issue hidden

**After Fix (Correct):**
- Detects: "Line 2: Non-monotonic time 99.0 (previous: 100.0)"
- Correctly identifies the problem

### Scenario 3: Real-world Network Delay
**File Content:**
```jsonl
{"step": 100, "wall_time": 1000.0}
{"step": 102, "wall_time": 1002.0}  # Step 101 missing
{"step": 101, "wall_time": 1001.5}  # Late arrival due to network delay
{"step": 103, "wall_time": 1003.0}
```

**Before Fix (Buggy):**
- Steps sorted: [100, 101, 102, 103] → Would pass validation!
- Network/data collection issues hidden

**After Fix (Correct):**
- Detects: "Line 3: Non-sequential step 101 (previous: 102)"
- Identifies potential data collection or network issues

## Usage

### Command Line
```bash
# Validate JSONL file for consistency
python -m rldk.io.validator --check-consistency my_training_log.jsonl

# Example output with the fix:
# Consistency errors in my_training_log.jsonl:
#   Line 3: Non-sequential step 2 (previous: 3)
#   Line 2: Non-monotonic time 99.0 (previous: 100.0)
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from rldk.io.validator import validate_jsonl_consistency
from pathlib import Path

# Validate consistency
is_consistent, issues = validate_jsonl_consistency(
    Path("my_training_log.jsonl"),
    check_sequential_steps=True,
    check_monotonic_time=True
)

if not is_consistent:
    print("Consistency issues found:")
    for issue in issues:
        print(f"  {issue}")
```

## Files Modified

1. `src/rldk/io/validator.py`
   - Removed sorting from `validate_jsonl_consistency` function
   - Updated comments to clarify validation is done in file order
   - Maintained all existing functionality and error reporting

## Conclusion

The bug has been successfully fixed. The `validate_jsonl_consistency` function now correctly validates JSONL files in their original file order, providing accurate detection of data integrity issues and correct line numbers in error reports. Users can now trust that the validation results reflect the actual state of their data files.
