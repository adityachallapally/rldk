# Convergence Normalization and Gradient Explosion Penalty Fixes

## Problem Description

Two additional critical bugs were identified and fixed in the evaluation functions:

### 1. Divide-by-zero in Convergence Normalization
**Location**: `evaluate_efficiency` function in `src/rldk/evals/suites.py`

**Issue**: The efficiency metric normalizes improvement by `max_expected_improvement = abs(rewards.mean()) * 0.5`. When the mean reward is zero (common early in RL training), this value becomes zero, causing a division by zero error.

### 2. Gradient Explosion Penalty Inflates Robustness Score
**Location**: `evaluate_adversarial` function in `src/rldk/evals/suites.py`

**Issue**: The gradient explosion penalty was being added directly to the metrics list, which meant that larger penalties (worse gradient behavior) actually increased the robustness score instead of decreasing it.

## Root Causes

### 1. Divide-by-zero in Convergence Normalization

**Before Fix (Problematic Code):**
```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE - Division by zero
if improvement > 0:
    # Normalize improvement
    max_expected_improvement = abs(rewards.mean()) * 0.5
    improvement_score = min(1.0, improvement / max_expected_improvement)
```

**Problem**: When `rewards.mean()` is zero (common early in RL training), `max_expected_improvement` becomes zero, causing a division by zero error when calculating `improvement_score`.

**Example**: 
```python
rewards = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]  # Zero mean
mean = 0.0
max_expected_improvement = abs(mean) * 0.5  # = 0.0
improvement_score = improvement / 0.0  # ❌ Division by zero!
```

### 2. Gradient Explosion Penalty Logic Error

**Before Fix (Problematic Code):**
```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE - Backwards penalty logic
if max_grad_norm > 10.0:
    grad_explosion_penalty = min(1.0, (max_grad_norm - 10.0) / 10.0)
    adversarial_metrics.append(("gradient_explosion_penalty", grad_explosion_penalty))
```

**Problem**: The penalty was being added directly to the metrics list. Since the final robustness score is the mean of all metrics, a larger penalty (worse behavior) actually increased the overall robustness score instead of decreasing it.

**Example**:
- Normal gradients (grad_norm=5.0): no penalty added
- Moderate explosion (grad_norm=15.0): penalty=0.5 added → **increases** robustness score
- Severe explosion (grad_norm=25.0): penalty=1.0 added → **increases** robustness score even more

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Convergence Normalization

**After Fix (Correct Code):**
```python
# FIXED CODE - Handle zero mean
if improvement > 0:
    # Normalize improvement
    # Avoid division by zero when mean is zero
    if rewards.mean() != 0:
        max_expected_improvement = abs(rewards.mean()) * 0.5
        improvement_score = min(1.0, improvement / max_expected_improvement)
    else:
        # When mean is zero, use a fallback approach
        # Use the standard deviation as a reference for normalization
        if rewards.std() > 0:
            max_expected_improvement = rewards.std() * 0.5
            improvement_score = min(1.0, improvement / max_expected_improvement)
        else:
            # If both mean and std are zero, assume good improvement
            improvement_score = 1.0
```

**Key Changes**:
- Check if mean is zero before division
- Use standard deviation as fallback when mean is zero
- Assume good improvement when both mean and std are zero
- Prevents division by zero errors

### 2. Fixed Gradient Explosion Penalty

**After Fix (Correct Code):**
```python
# FIXED CODE - Correct penalty logic
if max_grad_norm > 10.0:
    # Calculate penalty and invert it so that higher penalty = lower robustness
    grad_explosion_penalty = min(1.0, (max_grad_norm - 10.0) / 10.0)
    # Invert the penalty: 1 - penalty so that higher penalty = lower score
    grad_explosion_robustness = max(0, 1 - grad_explosion_penalty)
    adversarial_metrics.append(("gradient_explosion_robustness", grad_explosion_robustness))
```

**Key Changes**:
- Calculate the penalty as before
- Invert the penalty: `1 - penalty` so that higher penalty = lower robustness
- Rename metric to `gradient_explosion_robustness` for clarity
- Ensures that worse gradient behavior reduces the robustness score

## Before vs After Comparison

### Convergence Normalization

**Before Fix:**
```python
# Division by zero error
rewards = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
mean = 0.0
max_expected_improvement = abs(mean) * 0.5  # = 0.0
improvement_score = improvement / 0.0  # ❌ Division by zero!
```

**After Fix:**
```python
# Graceful handling
rewards = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
mean = 0.0
if mean != 0:
    # Normal calculation
else:
    # Fallback to std or assume good improvement
    improvement_score = 1.0  # ✅ No error
```

### Gradient Explosion Penalty

**Before Fix:**
```python
# Backwards logic
grad_norm = 25.0
penalty = min(1.0, (25.0 - 10.0) / 10.0)  # = 1.0
adversarial_metrics.append(("gradient_explosion_penalty", 1.0))
# Result: Higher penalty = higher robustness score ❌
```

**After Fix:**
```python
# Correct logic
grad_norm = 25.0
penalty = min(1.0, (25.0 - 10.0) / 10.0)  # = 1.0
robustness = max(0, 1 - 1.0)  # = 0.0
adversarial_metrics.append(("gradient_explosion_robustness", 0.0))
# Result: Higher penalty = lower robustness score ✅
```
